She is also a member of the Council on East Asian Studies at Yale.\nSince returning to Yale in January 2010, Professor Underhill offered a team-taught course on museums with Dr. David Odo from the Yale University Art Gallery during spring semester 2012 called Museums and Their Objects. During spring semester 2015, she will offer a related team-taught course with Professor Douglas Rogers from the Department of Anthropology, called Anthropology and the Material World. Seminar participants will discuss methods of interpreting material objects in archaeology and sociocultural anthropology for understanding cultures, and related methods used for researching museum objects. Professor Underhill traveled to Korea and Japan during the summer of 2014 to visit museums in preparation for a new course offered in the fall of 2014, Archaeology of East Asia (covering China, Japan, and Korea).\nLike the other archaeology professors, Professor Underhill aims to contribute to the protection of archaeological heritage resources throughout the world. In August 2013, she was part of a group of American archaeologists who testified at the State Department in Washington, D.C., in support of the request by the People\u2019s Republic of China to extend the restrictions established five years ago for the import of ancient cultural objects to the U.S. President Obama agreed to support this request.\nIn addition to publications listed in her full biography, she has added a 2013 edited book: A Companion to Chinese Archaeology, edited by Anne P.

{"department": "English", "bio": "Personal website\nI teach American literature, very broadly defined, ranging from the early national period through the twentieth century. My courses include introductory sections and lectures in American literary history, a senior seminar on William Faulkner, and a graduate seminar on literature and power. In 2007 I worked with Professor Caryl Phillips to develop \u201cThe Literature of the Middle Passage,\u201d a course on literature and the Atlantic slave trade that included a ten-day trip to Ghana.\nMy research explores the dream-life of power, or the relations between social imaginaries and legal institutions. My first book, The Prison and the American Imagination (Yale UP, 2009), is a cultural history of the penitentiary system. Tracing a genealogy of mass incarceration to the penal reforms of the early nineteenth century, I show how the prison came to be imagined as a scene of ceremonial death and rebirth. In a second book, The Oracle and the Curse (Harvard UP, 2013), I turn from sites of punishment to scenes of judgment. I tell the stories of dissenters, exhorters, and self-styled martyrs who made their claims to justice by invoking a \u201chigher law.\u201d The Oracle and the Curse argues that the formal secularization of the legal system allowed for new kinds of protest and militancy. Along the way, it considers how early American literature defined itself against the law\u2019s public sphere. My new project is an edition of \u201cThe Life and the Adventures of a Haunted Convict,\u201d an 1858 memoir by Austin Reed, a free black man who spent much of his life in New York\u2019s Auburn State Prison, to be published by Random House in 2016.\nI have written on contemporary media and the arts for Bomb, The Los Angeles Review of Books, Paper Monument, and Avidly.

Moving from the military trials of the\u00a0p\u00e9troleuse\u00a0to queer resistance cells active during the Second World War, I argue that first wave feminists and the avant-gardes offered one another a conceptual language to reimagine subjects exceptional to the \u201crights of man and citizen.\u201d The project follows these dialogues through the revolutionary upheavals peppering the late\u00a019th\u00a0and early\u00a020th\u00a0centuries, ultimately locating, amongst feminists, early socialists, and the avant-gardes, a radical alternative to liberal human rights discourses in formation at the same historical moment.

My work investigates the intersections of aesthetics and politics in literature, film and other media.\u00a0 My current project, Freedom Time: The Politics and Poetics of Black Experimental Writing, is forthcoming from The Johns Hopkins University Press in Fall 2014. That book offers a theoretical account of the black experimental writing that has emerged in the years following decolonization in the Caribbean and the Civil Rights era in the U.S.\u00a0 \u201cBlack Experimental Writing\u201d is at once a literary historical development, and a concept through which I analyze the ways writing engages race and expands the possibilities of expression.

Taking this approach, this book intervenes in ongoing studies of African American and Afro-Caribbean poetry, and responds to recent challenges that critical attention to black expressive culture is necessarily apolitical. Through attention to formal innovation, this book argues that black experimental writing pushes the limits of expression in order to extend the limits of thought and articulate different political questions and solutions.\nI am now working on a new project devoted to what I am calling \u201cphonographic poetry\u201d: African diaspora poetry performed with musical accompaniment and disseminated primarily through sound recording technology. This project allows me to connect the practices of institutions and practices of poetry and jazz, and to theorize collaborations. Rather than pursuing the more typical question of what music does for writing, this project also allows me to ask what kind of legitimating or other work poetry might be doing for otherwise \u201cmute\u201d music, with sound recording serving as the pivot between the two. Simultaneously, situating the practice within a post-WWII mass market, this project interrogates the pleasures and politics of listening in the formation of alternative communities. \nSelect Publications\n- \u201cAfter the End of the World: Sun Ra and the Ends of History,\u201d Black Camera Vol. 5, No. 1, Fall 2013.\n- \u201cA Woman is a Conjunction: The Ends of Improvisation in Claude McKay\u2019s Banjo: A Story Without a Plot,\u201d Callaloo 36.3, Summer 2013. \n- \u201cAnother Map of the South Side: Native Son as Postcolonial Novel.\u201d\u00a0 African American Review, Winter 2012.\n- \u201cAt the Border\u2014What Remains, Abides: Fragmentation, Nation and the Arrivant.\u201d\u00a0 The Routledge Companion to Anglophone Caribbean Literature, June 2011.\nUndergraduate Courses\nMusic and African American Literature; Representations of U.S. Slavery; Major English Poets; Caribbean Poetry; Modern Poetry; African American Literature 1790-1903", "website": "http://english.yale.edu/people/tenured-and-tenure-track-faculty-associate-professors/anthony-reed", "name": "Anthony Reed", "email": "anthony.reed@yale.edu"},

Her adoption of different perspectives became increasingly imaginative; for example, in \u201cThe Sick Child,\u201d from the collection Descending Figure (1980), her voice is that of a mother in a museum painting looking out at the bright gallery.

He is on the research staff of the National Bureau of Economic Research and has been a member and senior advisor of the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity, Washington, D.C. since 1972. Professor Nordhaus is current or past editor of several scientific journals and has served on the Executive Committees of the American Economic Association and the Eastern Economic Association. He serves on the Congressional Budget Office Panel of Economic Experts and was the first Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the Bureau of Economic Analysis. He was the first Chairman of the newly formed American Economic Association Committee on Federal Statistics. In 2004, he was awarded the prize of \u201cDistinguished Fellow\u201d by the American Economic Association.\nFrom 1977 to 1979, he was a Member of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. From 1986 to 1988, he served as the Provost of Yale University. He has served on several committees of the National Academy of Sciences including the Committee on Nuclear and Alternative Energy Systems, the Panel on Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming, the Committee on National Statistics, the Committee on Data and Research on Illegal Drugs, and the Committee on the Implications for Science and Society of Abrupt Climate Change. He recently chaired a Panel of the National Academy of Sciences which produced a report, Nature\u2019s Numbers, that recommended approaches to integrate environmental and other non-market activity into the national economic accounts.

His research has focused on economic growth and natural resources, the economics of climate change, as well as the resource constraints on economic growth. Since the 1970s, he has developed economic approaches to global warming, including the construction of integrated economic and scientific models (the DICE and RICE models) to determine the efficient path for coping with climate change, with the latest vintage, DICE-2007, published in A Question of Balance (Yale University Press, 2008). Professor Nordhaus has also studied wage and price behavior, health economics, augmented national accounting, the political business cycle, productivity, and the \u201cnew economy.\u201d His 1996 study of the economic history of lighting back to Babylonian times found that the measurement of long-term economic growth has been significantly underestimated. He returned to Mesopotamian economics with a study, published in 2002 before the war, of the costs of the U.S. war in Iraq, projecting a cost as high as $2 trillion.

Berger\u2019s work on impairment and representation extends earlier work he did on apocalypticism and the notion of the \u201cpost-apocalyptic\u201d in exploring the limits of language, the relations between language and non-language, the status of discursive objects imagined as somehow\u2013whether through global catastrophe, personal impairment, or religious or ethical imperative\u2013outside the bounds of discourse. How such texts take shape depends much on the particular concerns of their historical moments\u2013on whether, for instance, cognitive impairment is regarded as divine simpleness, genetic degeneration that threatens the social order, or a position on a neurological spectrum.

I am interested as well in the characterization of language deficits that result from brain damage, and in the interaction between linguistic processes and other cognitive capacities such as memory.\nTo this end, I use evidence from language deficits (aphasia), real-time processing and imaging techniques (in particular fMRI). The phenomena I focus on fall roughly within the confines of the syntax-lexico-semantic connection (both from the representational and processing perspective). This includes the characterization of the correspondence between argument structure and syntactic representation, establishing the connection in processing terms between the lexicon and syntactic representation, and determining the time-course of activation of syntactically opaque semantic combinatorial operations.", "website": "http://ling.yale.edu/people/maria-pi-ango", "name": "Maria Pi\u00f1ango", "email": "maria.pinango@yale.edu"},

I came to Yale in 1996; I had previously taught at Duke University and the University of Michigan. My research specialty is the behavioral ecology of nonhuman primates. My research primarily involves fieldwork on the animals in their natural habitats, but also involves collaborations with Professors Richard Bribiescas and Brenda Bradley and students associated with the Yale Reproductive Ecology Lab and the Yale Molecular Anthropology Lab. My first fieldwork was on white-faced capuchin monkeys in Panama. I did my doctoral research on mountain gorillas and stay involved in research on the gorillas for many years thereafter, including two years as Director of the Karisoke research Centre in Rwanda. Since 1993, I have been conducting research on chimpanzees at the site of Ngogo, in Kibale National Park, Uganda. My colleague John Mitani (University of Michigan) and I formally started the Ngogo Chimpanzee Project in 1995. Dr. Jeremiah Lwanga joined us as Project Manager in 1997, and Kevin Langergraber (Boston University) became our third Project Co-Director in 2011.

In connection with my work on print and the history of reading, he has been interested in several other disciplines, on topics such as new media, intellectual property. One common thread across these fields is the way different social worlds are built up out of different circulating media and ways of reading or hearing. At present he is working on a study of secularism. It is partly a reflection on the dilemmas of secularism in the present; but that reflection is framed by a study of secular culture in America in the period before it was called secularism (roughly from the early eighteenth century to the Civil War). This interest has led to two books currently in the works: one, a collection of essays coedited with Craig Calhoun and Jonathan VanAntwerpen, is to be published by Harvard University Press in 2010 under the title Varieties of Secularism in a Secular Age; it is a response to A Secular Age, by the philosopher Charles Taylor.

Earth, as a planet and a place, is implicated in this changing cosmology.

My courses include introductory sections and lectures in American literary history, a senior seminar on William Faulkner, and a graduate seminar on literature and power. In 2007 I worked with Professor Caryl Phillips to develop \u201cThe Literature of the Middle Passage,\u201d a course on literature and the Atlantic slave trade that included a ten-day trip to Ghana.\nMy research explores the dream-life of power, or the relations between social imaginaries and legal institutions. My first book, The Prison and the American Imagination (Yale UP, 2009), is a cultural history of the penitentiary system. Tracing a genealogy of mass incarceration to the penal reforms of the early nineteenth century, I show how the prison came to be imagined as a scene of ceremonial death and rebirth. In a second book, The Oracle and the Curse (Harvard UP, 2013), I turn from sites of punishment to scenes of judgment. I tell the stories of dissenters, exhorters, and self-styled martyrs who made their claims to justice by invoking a \u201chigher law.\u201d The Oracle and the Curse argues that the formal secularization of the legal system allowed for new kinds of protest and militancy.

{"department": "Department of Anthropology", "bio": "Professor Harms is a social-cultural anthropologist specializing in Southeast Asia and Vietnam. His ethnographic research in Vietnam has focused on the social and cultural effects of rapid urbanization on the fringes of Saigon\u2014Ho Chi Minh City. His book, Saigon\u2019s Edge: On the Margins of Ho Chi Minh City (University of Minnesota Press, 2011), explores how the production of symbolic and material space intersects with Vietnamese concepts of social space, rural-urban relations, and notions of \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside.\u201d\nMore recently, his work has focused on the uses and abuses of \u201cculture\u201d and \u201curban civility\u201d in urban Vietnam, and how this civilizing discourse entwines with spatial action in ways that legitimize broad-scale privatization. This new research explores how the study of social space can reveal unspoken relationships of power and ideology in post reform-era Vietnamese cities. While grounded ethnographically in Vietnam, his research and teaching seeks at all turns to connect with larger world-historic processes, unraveling the interaction between culture and politics, and the ways in which everyday acts are informed by larger political agendas. Harms offers a rotating mix of courses on Southeast Asian area studies, postwar Vietnam, urban anthropology, as well as theories of space, time, and social action.\n\nProfessor Harms is currently completing a three year NSF Funded study of the demolition and reconstruction of the urban landscape in two of Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s New Urban Zones. The research will illuminate how this dramatic urban transformation both responds to and transforms official and popular Vietnamese conceptions of \u201curban civilization\u201d (v\u0103n minh \u0111\u00f4 th\u1ecb).

My work investigates the intersections of aesthetics and politics in literature, film and other media.\u00a0 My current project, Freedom Time: The Politics and Poetics of Black Experimental Writing, is forthcoming from The Johns Hopkins University Press in Fall 2014. That book offers a theoretical account of the black experimental writing that has emerged in the years following decolonization in the Caribbean and the Civil Rights era in the U.S.\u00a0 \u201cBlack Experimental Writing\u201d is at once a literary historical development, and a concept through which I analyze the ways writing engages race and expands the possibilities of expression. Through extended analysis of work by N. H. Pritchard, NourbeSe Philip, Terrance Hayes, Kamau Brathwaite, Claudia Rankine, Douglas Kearney, Harryette Mullen, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Nathaniel Mackey, Freedom Time\u2019s analyses privilege poetics\u2014attention to the means by which literature achieves its effects\u2014to argue that form drives the politics of writing, rather than vice-versa. Taking this approach, this book intervenes in ongoing studies of African American and Afro-Caribbean poetry, and responds to recent challenges that critical attention to black expressive culture is necessarily apolitical. Through attention to formal innovation, this book argues that black experimental writing pushes the limits of expression in order to extend the limits of thought and articulate different political questions and solutions.\nI am now working on a new project devoted to what I am calling \u201cphonographic poetry\u201d: African diaspora poetry performed with musical accompaniment and disseminated primarily through sound recording technology. This project allows me to connect the practices of institutions and practices of poetry and jazz, and to theorize collaborations. Rather than pursuing the more typical question of what music does for writing, this project also allows me to ask what kind of legitimating or other work poetry might be doing for otherwise \u201cmute\u201d music, with sound recording serving as the pivot between the two. Simultaneously, situating the practice within a post-WWII mass market, this project interrogates the pleasures and politics of listening in the formation of alternative communities.\nSelect Publications\n\u201cAfter the End of the World: Sun Ra and the Ends of History,\u201d Black Camera Vol. 5, No. 1 (Fall 2013) (URL: http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.reed.html)\n\u201cA Woman is a Conjunction: The Ends of Improvisation in Claude McKay\u2019s Banjo: A Story Without a Plot,\u201d Callaloo 36.3 (Summer 2013) (URL: http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/callaloo/v036/36.3.reed.html)\n\u201cAnother Map of the South Side: Native Son as Postcolonial Novel.\u201d\u00a0 African American Review, Winter 2012 (URL: https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/african_american_review/v045/45.4.reed.pdf)\n\u201cAt the Border\u2014What Remains, Abides: Fragmentation, Nation and the Arrivant.\u201d\u00a0 The Routledge Companion to Anglophone Caribbean Literature (June 2011).\nUndergraduate Courses\nMusic and African American Literature, Representations of U.S. Slavery, Major English Poets, Caribbean Poetry, Modern Poetry, African American Literature 1790-1903", "website": "http://afamstudies.yale.edu/people/anthony-reed", "name": "Anthony Reed", "email": "Email:\u00a0anthony.reed@yale.edu"},

Born in Kenya, and raised in the U.K., Germany, Poland, Tanzania, and the U.S., Bradley\u2019s research and teaching focus on the study of film and media at the intersections of contemporary art and performance (with a particular interest in the development of the moving image in relation to cinema).\u00a0 Her scholarly approach to artistic practices in the fields of African-American cultural production, as well as the wider black diaspora expands and develops frameworks for thinking across these contexts, specifically in relation to global and transnational artistic and cinematic practices. \u00a0\nBradley is currently at work on two new scholarly book projects. The first is a recipient of a Creative Capital | Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant, and offers a critical examination of the black body across a range of experimental artistic practices that integrate film and other media.\u00a0 The second project examines the relationships between newer forms of experimental film and video practices, and traditional film genres. Recent and forthcoming articles and essays have focused on Black British video artists and The Art of the Moving Image in Britain After 1989 (forthcoming, Yale University Press, 2018); the cinematic development of black dance forms in relation to the critical interrogation of the loss of gesture in the history of cinema (forthcoming, TDR: The Drama Review, MIT Press, 2017); British artist and director, Steve McQueen (Black Camera: An International Film Journal, Indiana University Press, 2015); the televised 1991 Anita Hill hearings and centrality of black femininity in reimagining the stakes of black embodiment (Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge: Special Issue: Black Holes: Afro-Pessimism, Blackness and the Discourses of Modernity, 2016); the relevance of film theorist Laura Marks\u2019 notion of \u2018hapticality\u2019 or \u2018haptic visuality\u2019 for art and performance (Women and Performance: The Haptic, Routledge, 2015); Brazilian documentary filmmaker, Maria Beatriz Nascimento and the philosopher \u00c9douard Glissant (Discourse: Journal for Theoretical Studies in Media and Culture, Wayne State University Press, 2014).\u00a0 Bradley\u2019s writing has also been featured in Parkett, e-flux, and Art in America.\nBradley\u2019s interests in film and experimental video developed out of her research in Black Studies, anticolonial politics, continental philosophy, and aesthetic theory. These first came together at Williams College, where Bradley wrote an honors thesis that theorized the relationship between aesthetics and politics with respect to Documenta 11, an international art exhibition organized across five global platforms, curated by Okwui Enwezor in 2002. Writing on the concept of \u201cDemocracy Unrealized,\u201d she became interested in Documenta\u2019s video and film program, consisting of 35 films by 26 directors.\nBradley\u2019s research and teaching draw upon critical topics in Film Theory, Feminist Film Theory, New Media Studies, together with key developments in contemporary art, bringing these to bear on narrative cinema and Afrodiasporic cultural practices spanning the fields of art, film, and performance in a global context.\u00a0 In London, Bradley curated two international symposia related to the study of Afrodiasporic thought and aesthetics, dedicated to exploring these overlaps in cultural practice: (BFI) British Film Institute, Blackness, Cinema, and the Moving Image (2016); The Serpentine Galleries, Wayward Aesthetics (2017).", "website": "http://afamstudies.yale.edu/people/rizvana-bradley", "name": "Rizvana Bradley", "email": "Email:\u00a0rizvana.bradley@yale.edu"},

My research primarily involves fieldwork on the animals in their natural habitats, but also involves collaborations with Professors Richard Bribiescas and Brenda Bradley and students associated with the Yale Reproductive Ecology Lab and the Yale Molecular Anthropology Lab. My first fieldwork was on white-faced capuchin monkeys in Panama.

In 2007 I worked with Professor Caryl Phillips to develop \u201cThe Literature of the Middle Passage,\u201d a course on literature and the Atlantic slave trade that included a ten-day trip to Ghana.\nMy research explores the dream-life of power, or the relations between social imaginaries and legal institutions. My first book, The Prison and the American Imagination (Yale UP, 2009), is a cultural history of the penitentiary system. Tracing a genealogy of mass incarceration to the penal reforms of the early nineteenth century, I show how the prison came to be imagined as a scene of ceremonial death and rebirth. In a second book, The Oracle and the Curse (Harvard UP, 2013), I turn from sites of punishment to scenes of judgment. I tell the stories of dissenters, exhorters, and self-styled martyrs who made their claims to justice by invoking a \u201chigher law.\u201d The Oracle and the Curse argues that the formal secularization of the legal system allowed for new kinds of protest and militancy.

From 1975 to 1981 he edited Nineteenth-Century Fiction, the journal devoted to British and American fiction. The Hero of the Waverley Novels (1963, 1968, and 1992 with additional essays on Scott) relates Scott\u2019s achievement to 18th- and 19th-century ideas of property. Thackeray: A Collection of Critical Essays (1968) is a volume in the Twentieth-Century Views series. The City of Dickens (1971, 1986) and George Eliot and Blackmail (1985) interpret the work of these two novelists against the background of Victorian social history. Two subsequent books on Dickens, From Copyright to Copperfield (1987) and Dickens Redressed: The Art of \u201cBleak House\u201d and \u201cHard Times\u201d (2000), take off from biographical criticism. Reflections on the Hero as Quixote (1981) is an excursion in comparative literature and the theme of justice. Strong Representations: Narrative and Circumstantial Evidence in England (1992) concerns narrative in several disciplines from 1750 to 1900, but especially criminal prosecution and the novel. Freud\u2019s Wishful Dream Book (1994) is a close reading of Freud\u2019s famous book of 1900. Hamlet in His Modern Guises (2001) reads Shakespeare\u2019s play in the light of other revenge tragedies and then shows how it was recast in novels by Goethe, Scott, Dickens, Melville, and Joyce. What is Honor? (2008) traces a genealogy of honor that operates as a moral imperative and still very much matters to us today.\u00a0Chapters on Aristotle, Cicero, and Shakespeare introduce this concept of honor as it replays in the drama and fiction of the Enlightenment, and especially the writings of Mandeville and Montesquieu, Rousseau, Kant, and Adam Smith.\nMr. Welsh, who taught at Pittsburgh and UCLA before rejoining the Yale faculty in 1991, has been the recipient of Guggenheim, N.E.H., Rockefeller Foundation, and National Humanities Center fellowships.

My work investigates the intersections of aesthetics and politics in literature, film and other media.\u00a0 My current project, Freedom Time: The Politics and Poetics of Black Experimental Writing, is forthcoming from The Johns Hopkins University Press in Fall 2014. That book offers a theoretical account of the black experimental writing that has emerged in the years following decolonization in the Caribbean and the Civil Rights era in the U.S.\u00a0 \u201cBlack Experimental Writing\u201d is at once a literary historical development, and a concept through which I analyze the ways writing engages race and expands the possibilities of expression.

Taking this approach, this book intervenes in ongoing studies of African American and Afro-Caribbean poetry, and responds to recent challenges that critical attention to black expressive culture is necessarily apolitical. Through attention to formal innovation, this book argues that black experimental writing pushes the limits of expression in order to extend the limits of thought and articulate different political questions and solutions.\nI am now working on a new project devoted to what I am calling \u201cphonographic poetry\u201d: African diaspora poetry performed with musical accompaniment and disseminated primarily through sound recording technology. This project allows me to connect the practices of institutions and practices of poetry and jazz, and to theorize collaborations. Rather than pursuing the more typical question of what music does for writing, this project also allows me to ask what kind of legitimating or other work poetry might be doing for otherwise \u201cmute\u201d music, with sound recording serving as the pivot between the two. Simultaneously, situating the practice within a post-WWII mass market, this project interrogates the pleasures and politics of listening in the formation of alternative communities. \nSelect Publications\n- \u201cAfter the End of the World: Sun Ra and the Ends of History,\u201d Black Camera Vol. 5, No. 1, Fall 2013.\n- \u201cA Woman is a Conjunction: The Ends of Improvisation in Claude McKay\u2019s Banjo: A Story Without a Plot,\u201d Callaloo 36.3, Summer 2013. \n- \u201cAnother Map of the South Side: Native Son as Postcolonial Novel.\u201d\u00a0 African American Review, Winter 2012.\n- \u201cAt the Border\u2014What Remains, Abides: Fragmentation, Nation and the Arrivant.\u201d\u00a0 The Routledge Companion to Anglophone Caribbean Literature, June 2011.\nUndergraduate Courses\nMusic and African American Literature; Representations of U.S. Slavery; Major English Poets; Caribbean Poetry; Modern Poetry; African American Literature 1790-1903", "website": "http://english.yale.edu/people/tenured-and-tenure-track-faculty-associate-professors/anthony-reed", "name": "Anthony Reed", "email": "anthony.reed@yale.edu"},

In connection with my work on print and the history of reading, he has been interested in several other disciplines, on topics such as new media, intellectual property. One common thread across these fields is the way different social worlds are built up out of different circulating media and ways of reading or hearing. At present he is working on a study of secularism. It is partly a reflection on the dilemmas of secularism in the present; but that reflection is framed by a study of secular culture in America in the period before it was called secularism (roughly from the early eighteenth century to the Civil War). This interest has led to two books currently in the works: one, a collection of essays coedited with Craig Calhoun and Jonathan VanAntwerpen, is to be published by Harvard University Press in 2010 under the title Varieties of Secularism in a Secular Age; it is a response to A Secular Age, by the philosopher Charles Taylor.

His 2000 biography of the Nigerian musician Fela Anikulapo-Kuti (Fela: The Life & Times of an African Musical Icon) uses the life and music of one of the most influential African musicians of the post-WWII era to explore themes of African post-coloniality, musical and cultural interchange between cultures of Africa and the African diaspora, and the political uses of music in Africa. His documentation of \u201cAfrobeat\u201d will continue with the forthcoming as-told-to autobiography Tony Allen: Master Drummer of Afrobeat. His 2007 study of Jamaican dub music (Dub: Soundscapes and Shattered Songs in Jamaican Reggae) examines the ways in which the studio-based innovations of Jamaican recording engineers during the 1970s transformed the structure and concept of the post-WWII popular song, as well as the theme of how sound technology can be used to articulate themes of spirituality, history and politics. His forthcoming book Technotopia 1969: Miles Davis at the Crossroadssurveys an under-documented period in the life and career of Miles Davis, examines the role of sound rcordings in the construction of jazz history, and takes an analytical approach to the years of \u201celectric jazz\u201d prior to its commodification as \u201cjazz-rock fusion.\u201d\nUndergraduate courses that Professor Veal has taught have included: Music Cultures of the World; Theory & Practice of Ethnomusicology; Traditional and Contemporary Musics of Sub-Saharan Africa; Jazz in Transition 1960 -1985; Funk \u2013 The Re-Africanization of the American Popular Song Form; Jazz & Architecture; and Popular Music: The Experimental Tradition.

My courses include introductory sections and lectures in American literary history, a senior seminar on William Faulkner, and a graduate seminar on literature and power. In 2007 I worked with Professor Caryl Phillips to develop \u201cThe Literature of the Middle Passage,\u201d a course on literature and the Atlantic slave trade that included a ten-day trip to Ghana.\nMy research explores the dream-life of power, or the relations between social imaginaries and legal institutions. My first book, The Prison and the American Imagination (Yale UP, 2009), is a cultural history of the penitentiary system. Tracing a genealogy of mass incarceration to the penal reforms of the early nineteenth century, I show how the prison came to be imagined as a scene of ceremonial death and rebirth. In a second book, The Oracle and the Curse (Harvard UP, 2013), I turn from sites of punishment to scenes of judgment. I tell the stories of dissenters, exhorters, and self-styled martyrs who made their claims to justice by invoking a \u201chigher law.\u201d The Oracle and the Curse argues that the formal secularization of the legal system allowed for new kinds of protest and militancy.

His current research is on the representation of cognitive and linguistic impairment in modern fiction. This project presents questions that recur consistently in his teaching as well: how science, popular beliefs and ideology, social and political fears and desires, theories of language, literary genres, religion, and ethics are continually in tension, and how these tensions can be approached through literary texts. Berger\u2019s work on impairment and representation extends earlier work he did on apocalypticism and the notion of the \u201cpost-apocalyptic\u201d in exploring the limits of language, the relations between language and non-language, the status of discursive objects imagined as somehow\u2013whether through global catastrophe, personal impairment, or religious or ethical imperative\u2013outside the bounds of discourse. How such texts take shape depends much on the particular concerns of their historical moments\u2013on whether, for instance, cognitive impairment is regarded as divine simpleness, genetic degeneration that threatens the social order, or a position on a neurological spectrum.

These couples cannot find safe, affordable, legal, and effective IVF services in their home countries, and their stories offer a window into the world of infertility\u2014a world that is replete with pain, fear, danger, frustration, and financial burden. These hardships dispel any notion that traveling for IVF treatment is reproductive tourism. The magnitude of reprotravel to Dubai, Inhorn contends, reflects the failure of countries to meet their citizens\u2019 reproductive needs, which suggests the necessity of creating new forms of activism that advocate for developing alternate pathways to parenthood, reducing preventable forms of infertility, supporting the infertile, and making safe and low-cost IVF available worldwide.", "website": "http://anthropology.yale.edu/people/marcia-inhorn", "name": "Marcia Inhorn", "email": "marcia.inhorn@yale.edu"},

The phenomena I focus on fall roughly within the confines of the syntax-lexico-semantic connection (both from the representational and processing perspective).

His book, Saigon\u2019s Edge: On the Margins of Ho Chi Minh City (University of Minnesota Press, 2011), explores how the production of symbolic and material space intersects with Vietnamese concepts of social space, rural-urban relations, and notions of \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside.\u201d\nMore recently, his work has focused on the uses and abuses of \u201cculture\u201d and \u201curban civility\u201d in urban Vietnam, and how this civilizing discourse entwines with spatial action in ways that legitimize broad-scale privatization. This new research explores how the study of social space can reveal unspoken relationships of power and ideology in post reform-era Vietnamese cities. While grounded ethnographically in Vietnam, his research and teaching seeks at all turns to connect with larger world-historic processes, unraveling the interaction between culture and politics, and the ways in which everyday acts are informed by larger political agendas. Harms offers a rotating mix of courses on Southeast Asian area studies, postwar Vietnam, urban anthropology, as well as theories of space, time, and social action.\n\nProfessor Harms is currently completing a three year NSF Funded study of the demolition and reconstruction of the urban landscape in two of Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s New Urban Zones.

My work investigates the intersections of aesthetics and politics in literature, film and other media.\u00a0 My current project, Freedom Time: The Politics and Poetics of Black Experimental Writing, is forthcoming from The Johns Hopkins University Press in Fall 2014. That book offers a theoretical account of the black experimental writing that has emerged in the years following decolonization in the Caribbean and the Civil Rights era in the U.S.\u00a0 \u201cBlack Experimental Writing\u201d is at once a literary historical development, and a concept through which I analyze the ways writing engages race and expands the possibilities of expression. Through extended analysis of work by N. H. Pritchard, NourbeSe Philip, Terrance Hayes, Kamau Brathwaite, Claudia Rankine, Douglas Kearney, Harryette Mullen, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Nathaniel Mackey, Freedom Time\u2019s analyses privilege poetics\u2014attention to the means by which literature achieves its effects\u2014to argue that form drives the politics of writing, rather than vice-versa. Taking this approach, this book intervenes in ongoing studies of African American and Afro-Caribbean poetry, and responds to recent challenges that critical attention to black expressive culture is necessarily apolitical. Through attention to formal innovation, this book argues that black experimental writing pushes the limits of expression in order to extend the limits of thought and articulate different political questions and solutions.\nI am now working on a new project devoted to what I am calling \u201cphonographic poetry\u201d: African diaspora poetry performed with musical accompaniment and disseminated primarily through sound recording technology. This project allows me to connect the practices of institutions and practices of poetry and jazz, and to theorize collaborations. Rather than pursuing the more typical question of what music does for writing, this project also allows me to ask what kind of legitimating or other work poetry might be doing for otherwise \u201cmute\u201d music, with sound recording serving as the pivot between the two. Simultaneously, situating the practice within a post-WWII mass market, this project interrogates the pleasures and politics of listening in the formation of alternative communities.\nSelect Publications\n\u201cAfter the End of the World: Sun Ra and the Ends of History,\u201d Black Camera Vol. 5, No. 1 (Fall 2013) (URL: http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.reed.html)\n\u201cA Woman is a Conjunction: The Ends of Improvisation in Claude McKay\u2019s Banjo: A Story Without a Plot,\u201d Callaloo 36.3 (Summer 2013) (URL: http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/callaloo/v036/36.3.reed.html)\n\u201cAnother Map of the South Side: Native Son as Postcolonial Novel.\u201d\u00a0 African American Review, Winter 2012 (URL: https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/african_american_review/v045/45.4.reed.pdf)\n\u201cAt the Border\u2014What Remains, Abides: Fragmentation, Nation and the Arrivant.\u201d\u00a0 The Routledge Companion to Anglophone Caribbean Literature (June 2011).\nUndergraduate Courses\nMusic and African American Literature, Representations of U.S. Slavery, Major English Poets, Caribbean Poetry, Modern Poetry, African American Literature 1790-1903", "website": "http://afamstudies.yale.edu/people/anthony-reed", "name": "Anthony Reed", "email": "Email:\u00a0anthony.reed@yale.edu"},

Born in Kenya, and raised in the U.K., Germany, Poland, Tanzania, and the U.S., Bradley\u2019s research and teaching focus on the study of film and media at the intersections of contemporary art and performance (with a particular interest in the development of the moving image in relation to cinema).\u00a0 Her scholarly approach to artistic practices in the fields of African-American cultural production, as well as the wider black diaspora expands and develops frameworks for thinking across these contexts, specifically in relation to global and transnational artistic and cinematic practices. \u00a0\nBradley is currently at work on two new scholarly book projects. The first is a recipient of a Creative Capital | Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant, and offers a critical examination of the black body across a range of experimental artistic practices that integrate film and other media.\u00a0 The second project examines the relationships between newer forms of experimental film and video practices, and traditional film genres. Recent and forthcoming articles and essays have focused on Black British video artists and The Art of the Moving Image in Britain After 1989 (forthcoming, Yale University Press, 2018); the cinematic development of black dance forms in relation to the critical interrogation of the loss of gesture in the history of cinema (forthcoming, TDR: The Drama Review, MIT Press, 2017); British artist and director, Steve McQueen (Black Camera: An International Film Journal, Indiana University Press, 2015); the televised 1991 Anita Hill hearings and centrality of black femininity in reimagining the stakes of black embodiment (Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge: Special Issue: Black Holes: Afro-Pessimism, Blackness and the Discourses of Modernity, 2016); the relevance of film theorist Laura Marks\u2019 notion of \u2018hapticality\u2019 or \u2018haptic visuality\u2019 for art and performance (Women and Performance: The Haptic, Routledge, 2015); Brazilian documentary filmmaker, Maria Beatriz Nascimento and the philosopher \u00c9douard Glissant (Discourse: Journal for Theoretical Studies in Media and Culture, Wayne State University Press, 2014).\u00a0 Bradley\u2019s writing has also been featured in Parkett, e-flux, and Art in America.\nBradley\u2019s interests in film and experimental video developed out of her research in Black Studies, anticolonial politics, continental philosophy, and aesthetic theory. These first came together at Williams College, where Bradley wrote an honors thesis that theorized the relationship between aesthetics and politics with respect to Documenta 11, an international art exhibition organized across five global platforms, curated by Okwui Enwezor in 2002. Writing on the concept of \u201cDemocracy Unrealized,\u201d she became interested in Documenta\u2019s video and film program, consisting of 35 films by 26 directors.\nBradley\u2019s research and teaching draw upon critical topics in Film Theory, Feminist Film Theory, New Media Studies, together with key developments in contemporary art, bringing these to bear on narrative cinema and Afrodiasporic cultural practices spanning the fields of art, film, and performance in a global context.\u00a0 In London, Bradley curated two international symposia related to the study of Afrodiasporic thought and aesthetics, dedicated to exploring these overlaps in cultural practice: (BFI) British Film Institute, Blackness, Cinema, and the Moving Image (2016); The Serpentine Galleries, Wayward Aesthetics (2017).", "website": "http://afamstudies.yale.edu/people/rizvana-bradley", "name": "Rizvana Bradley", "email": "Email:\u00a0rizvana.bradley@yale.edu"},

Saden Professor of\u00a0 Political Science. He specializes in the comparative political economy of labor\u00a0 markets and social welfare in Europe and the United States. He teaches graduate\u00a0 and undergraduate courses on the economic, political and social foundations of\u00a0 social policy and market regulation in developed capitalist democracies.\n\u00a0\nAmong\u00a0 other things, Swenson is the author of two books, Fair Shares: Unions, Pay and Politics in Sweden and West\u00a0 Germany (1989) and Capitalists\u00a0 against Markets: The Making of Labor Markets and Welfare States in the United\u00a0 States and Sweden (2002), which received honorable mention for the\u00a0 APSA Luebbert Prize for best book in Comparative Politics. He was awarded\u00a0 the APSA\u2019s Follett Prize for best article in politics and history for\u00a0 \u201cVarieties of Capitalist Interests: Power, Institutions, and the\u00a0 Regulatory Welfare State in the United States and Sweden\u201d (Studies in American Political\u00a0 Development, 2004).\n\u00a0\nSwenson\u2019s\u00a0 current project, The American\u00a0 Medical Disorder: A Century of Health Politics, turns to the\u00a0 history and political economy of medical reform and medical progress. It covers\u00a0 subjects like medical education and research, public health, pharmaceutical\u00a0 regulation, the financing, organization, and control of health care delivery\u00a0 through private and social insurance, and the movement for evidence-based\u00a0 medical decisions for cost-effective health care. This is part of a larger\u00a0 long-term comparative research project analyzing the shifting interests\u00a0 and coalitions of organized provider, business, and labor groups in the\u00a0 evolution of national health care systems. A piece of the comparative work has\u00a0 been published as \u201cGood Distribution, Bad Delivery, and Ugly Politics: The\u00a0 Traumatic Beginnings of Germany\u2019s Health Care System,\u201d in Shapiro,\u00a0 Swenson, and Donno, eds., Divide\u00a0 and Deal: The Politics of Distribution in Democracies (2008).\n\u00a0\nFor Office Hours, click here.", "website": "http://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/peter-swenson", "name": "Peter Swenson", "email": "peter.swenson@yale.edu"},
